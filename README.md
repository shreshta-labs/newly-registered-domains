# Newly Registered Domain name lists

Newly registered domain names(NRD) pose a significant risk to enterprises and anyone who operates a network.

Threat actors also register new domain names for malicious activity such as phishing, malware, spam campaigns, etc.
Because domain names are cheap, threat actors often register new ones using stolen credit cards, etc.

For a detailed perspective on why monitoring DNS traffic to NRDs is critical, please see our blog post [What are Newly Registered Domain Names?](https://shreshtait.com/blog/2024/01/what-are-newly-registered-domain-names/)

At [Shreshta](https://shreshtait.com), we detect and curate two NRD lists.

- NRD-1w – The domain names registered in the past week.
- NRD-1m – The domain names registered in the past month.

This repository contains 10,000 NRD domain names from NRD-1w and NRD-1m datasets with the community. The data is updated every day at 1300 IST.
